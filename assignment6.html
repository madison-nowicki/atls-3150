    <h1>My Favorite Chocolate Cupcake Recipe</h1>

    <p>I've had a passion for baking (and for chocolate) ever since I was kid. 
        This <strong> Chocolate Cupcake Recipe </strong> is <strong> rich </strong> and 
        <strong> decadent </strong> and everything you could ever want in a 
        chocolate cupcake.

        The creator of this recipe is one of my favorite bakers, 
        Jenna Barnard of <a href="https://butternutbakeryblog.com/" title="Butternut Bakery Home Page"> 
            Butternut Bakery.
